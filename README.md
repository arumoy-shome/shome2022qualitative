# Qualitative Analysis of Data vs. Model Centric Fairness Testing

## Dependencies

The analytical work was done using Python 3.9, consider creating
a virtualenv prior to running the code.

    python3 -m venv .venv # assuming python3 points to python3.9

To activate the virtualenv run the following command. This makes sure
that the unversioned python & pip binaries point to the appropriate
versions.

    source .venv/bin/activate

The python dependencies are listed in requirements.txt. You can
install all dependencies with pip.

    pip install -r requirements.txt
