In this document we present the analysis of the results collected in
this study.

We consider each protected attribute for each dataset as a separate
analysis. For each analysis, we wish to answer the following
questions:

1. Is the model making unfair predictions?
2. If so, do the model-centric fairness metrics *indicate* this unfair
   behaviour?
3. If so, do the data-centric fairness metrics *explain* this unfair
   behaviour?

* Summary of results
Following table presents a concise summary of the results obtained in
this study.

As seen from Figure [[fig-adult-sex-lr-cm-rate]], the FNs for the
unprivileged group is higher than the FNs for the privileged group.
This indicates that the model is unfair towards the unprivileged
group. Given an example from the unprivileged group, the model is more
likely to incorrectly classify it as a negative example.

** Do the model-centric metrics indicate unfairness?

#+name: fig-adult-sex-lr-pre-rec
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:adult_barplot_prot-sex_mod-lr_acc-pre-rec-f1.png]]

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-mod-disparate-impact]], the disparate impact
for the logisticregression model is $<1$ which indicates that the
unprivileged group is at a disadvantage.

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-lr-pre-rec]], the recall for the unprivileged
group is lower than that of the privileged group. This indicates that
when identifying positive examples, the model performs worse for the
unprivileged group.

** Do the data-centric metrics explain unfairness?

#+caption: Disparate Impact for data
#+name: fig-adult-sex-data-disparate-impact
[[file:adult_barplot_prot-sex_mod-all_disparate-impact.png]]

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-data-disparate-impact]], the disparate impact
across all subsets of the data is $<1$ which indicates that the
unprivileged group is at a disadvantage.

#+caption: Base rate
#+name: fig-adult-sex-base-rate
[[file:adult_barplot_prot-sex_base-rate.png]]

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-base-rate]]:

#+name: eq-base-rate-unpriv
\begin{equation}
\text{base rate for unprivileged group} = P(Y=1 | D=\text{unprivileged}) = 0.120 \\
\implies P(Y=0 | D=\text{unprivileged}) = 1 - P(Y=1 | D=\text{unprivileged}) = 0.88
\end{equation}

Similarly,

#+name: eq-base-rate-priv
\begin{equation}
\text{base rate for privileged group} = P(Y=1 | D=\text{privileged}) = 0.310 \\
\implies P(Y=0 | D=\text{privileged}) = 1 - P(Y=1 | D=\text{privileged}) = 0.69
\end{equation}

Consider that we pick a random example from the dataset each from the
privileged & unprivileged group. From Equations [[eq-base-rate-unpriv]] &
[[eq-base-rate-priv]], it is more likely that the example from the
unprivileged group is negative compared to the privileged group.

Thus for the unprivileged group, the model is more biased towards the
negative class compared to the privileged group, which examples why
the recall for the unprivileged group is lower than that of the
privileged group.

** Is the model unfair?

#+caption: CM for logisticregression
#+name: fig-adult-sex-dt-cm-rate
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:adult_heatmap_prot-sex_mod-dt_cm-rate.png]]

As seen from Figure [[fig-adult-sex-dt-cm-rate]], the FNs for the
unprivileged group is higher than the FNs for the privileged group.
This indicates that the model is unfair towards the unprivileged
group. Similar bias as seen in Section [[#sec-adult-sex-lr]].

** Do the model-centric metrics indicate unfairness?

#+name: fig-adult-sex-dt-pre-rec
#+attr_html: :width 100%
[[file:adult_barplot_prot-sex_mod-dt_acc-pre-rec-f1.png]]

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-mod-disparate-impact]], the disparate impact
for the decisiontreeclassifier model is $<1$ which indicates that the
unprivileged group is at a disadvantage.

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-dt-pre-rec]], both the precision & recall for
the unprivileged group is lower than that of the privileged group.
This indicates that when identifying positive examples, the model
performs worse for the unprivileged group. This is corroborated by
Figure [[fig-adult-sex-dt-cm-rate]] where the model does not identify the
TPs for the unprivileged group as well as the privileged group. The
model also has higher FNs for the unprivileged group vs. privileged
group.

** Do the data-centric metrics explain unfairness?

#+caption: Disparate Impact for data
#+name: fig-adult-sex-data-disparate-impact
[[file:adult_barplot_prot-sex_mod-all_disparate-impact.png]]

From Figure [[fig-adult-sex-data-disparate-impact]], the disparate impact
across all subsets of the data is $<1$ which indicates that the
unprivileged group is at a disadvantage.

Similar explaination for precision-recall as Section [[#sec-adult-sex-lr]].
