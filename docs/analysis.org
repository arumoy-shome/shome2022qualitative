In this document we present the analysis of the results collected in
this study.

We consider each protected attribute for each dataset as a separate
analysis. For each analysis, we wish to answer the following
questions:

1. Is the model making unfair predictions?
2. If so, do the model-centric fairness metrics *indicate* this unfair
   behaviour?
3. If so, do the data-centric fairness metrics *explain* this unfair
   behaviour?

* Summary of results
Following table presents a concise summary of the results obtained in
this study.
