These instructions are to setup the replication package for the paper
title *Data vs. Model Machine Learning Fairness Testing: An Empirical
Study* submitted to IJCAI 2023 main track.

# Dependencies

The source code for all experiments and data analysis is in
`src.zip`. On a unix/freebsd system you can unzip the contents from
the command line using `unzip src.zip`. The contents of `src.zip` are
as follows:

The datasets **used** in this study are present in `datasets.zip`. You
**do not** need to unzip this file since the provided Docker
environment will extract & move the datasets to the correct location
automatically.

The results generated **from** the experiments are stored in csv files
in `data.zip`. You should unzip this file if you wish to run the
analysis present in the Jupyter notebooks present in the `docs`
directory. Make sure to move or make appropriate copies of the
original data if you wish to generate the data youself using the
scripts provided in `bin` directory.

Use the provided Dockerfile to build a docker image & run your
commands within a docker container. To build an image tagged
`foobarbaz` run the following command.

```sh
docker build -t foobarbaz .
```

The following command mounts the current working directory to the
`/app` directory within a container & runs the
`bin/exp-feature-sets.bash` script for 5 iterations. The container is
automatically cleaned up after the script finishes executing.

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/app" foobarbaz ./bin/exp-feature-sets.bash 5
```

The number of cpus & memory available to the container can be
specified using the `--cpus` & `--memory` flags. The following command
limits the number of cores to 8 & the available memory to 32GB.

```sh
docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/app" --cpus 8.0 --memory 320000000000 foobarbaz ./bin/exp-feature-sets.bash 5
```

# Running the experiments

Use the python and bash scripts provided in the `bin/` directory to
run the experiments. Refer to the documentation within the files for
more details. In general, the python scripts should be used to run the
experiment for a particular dataset while the bash scripts can be used
to run the experiment for all datasets.

# Analysing the results

The data analysis is conducted using Jupyter notebooks present in the
`docs/` directory.
